## Introduction
cvxlab is a Python-embedded, open-source modeling framework able to generate and to solve convex numerical optimization problems.
The framework extends the functionalities of the cvxpy package in the following ways:
- It enables to express your problem in a natural way that follows the math, rather than in the restrictive standard form required by solvers. You can easily conceptualize numerical problem (sets, variables, symbolic equations) with an excel-based or yaml-based interface (no code experience requested). 
- It allows the generation and solution of multiple integrated optimization problems at the same time (allowing models integration or decomposition);
- It simplifies exogenous data input to the model based on excel, and it centralizes data management based on SQLite;

## Installation
To install the package, use:
```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage
Here's a brief example of how to use the package:
```python
import pyesm

# Define your problem
# ...example code...

# Solve the problem
# ...example code...
```
For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the [Usage Guide](usage.rst).

## Examples
